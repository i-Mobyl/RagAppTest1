We've\\nlearned a lot since then, but if I were choosing now that's still\\nthe one I'd pick.Another thing we tell founders is not to worry too much about the\\nbusiness model, at least at first.  Not because making money is\\nunimportant, but because it's so much easier than building something\\ngreat.A couple weeks ago I realized that if you put those two ideas\\ntogether, you get something surprising.  Make something people want.\\nDon't worry too much about making money.  What you've got is a\\ndescription of a charity.When you get an unexpected result like this, it could either be a\\nbug or a new discovery.  Either businesses aren't supposed to be\\nlike charities, and we've proven by reductio ad absurdum that one\\nor both of the principles we began with is false.  Or we have a new\\nidea.I suspect it's the latter, because as soon as this thought occurred\\nto me, a whole bunch of other things fell into place.ExamplesFor example, Craigslist.  It's not a charity, but they run it like\\none.  And they're astoundingly successful.  When you scan down the\\nlist of most popular web sites, the number of employees at Craigslist\\nlooks like a misprint. Their revenues aren't as high as they could\\nbe, but most startups would be happy to trade places with them.In Patrick O'Brian's novels, his captains always try to get upwind\\nof their opponents.  If you're upwind, you decide when and if to\\nengage the other ship.  Craigslist is effectively upwind of enormous\\nrevenues.  They'd face some challenges if they wanted to make more,\\nbut not the sort you face when you're tacking upwind, trying to\\nforce a crappy product on ambivalent users by spending ten times\\nas much on sales as on development.  [1]I'm not saying startups should aim to end up like Craigslist.\\nThey're a product of unusual circumstances.  But they're a good\\nmodel for the early phases.Google looked a lot like a charity in the beginning. They didn't\\nhave ads for over a year.  At year 1, Google was indistinguishable\\nfrom a nonprofit.  If a nonprofit or government organization had\\nstarted a project to index the web, Google at year 1 is the limit\\nof what they'd have produced.Back when I was working on spam filters I thought it would be a\\ngood idea to have a web-based email service with good spam filtering.\\nI wasn't thinking of it as a company.  I just wanted to keep people\\nfrom getting spammed.  But as I thought more about this project, I\\nrealized it would probably have to be a company.  It would cost\\nsomething to run, and it would be a pain to fund with grants and\\ndonations.That was a surprising realization.  Companies often claim to be\\nbenevolent, but it was surprising to realize there were purely\\nbenevolent projects that had to be embodied as companies to work.I didn't want to start another company, so I didn't do it.  But if\\nsomeone had, they'd probably be quite rich now.  There was a window\\nof about two years when spam was increasing rapidly but all the big\\nemail services had terrible filters.  If someone had launched a\\nnew, spam-free mail service, users would have flocked to it.Notice the pattern here?  From either direction we get to the same\\nspot.  If you start from successful startups, you find they often\\nbehaved like nonprofits.  And if you start from ideas for nonprofits,\\nyou find they'd often make good startups.PowerHow wide is this territory?  Would all good nonprofits be good\\ncompanies?  Possibly not.  What makes Google so valuable is that\\ntheir users have money.  If you make people with money love you,\\nyou can probably get some of it.  But could you also base a successful\\nstartup on behaving like a nonprofit to people who don't have money?\\nCould you, for example, grow a successful startup out of curing an\\nunfashionable but deadly disease like malaria?I'm not sure, but I suspect that if you pushed this idea, you'd be\\nsurprised how far it would go.  For example, people who apply to Y\\nCombinator don't generally have much money, and yet we can profit\\nby helping them, because with our help they could make money.  Maybe\\nthe situation is similar with malaria.  Maybe an organization that\\nhelped lift its weight off a country could benefit from the resulting\\ngrowth.I'm not proposing this is a serious idea.  I don't know anything\\nabout malaria.  But I've been kicking ideas around long enough to\\nknow when I come across a powerful one.One way to guess how far an idea extends is to ask yourself at what\\npoint you'd bet against it.  The thought of betting against benevolence\\nis alarming in the same way as saying that something is technically\\nimpossible.  You're just asking to be made a fool of, because these\\nare such powerful forces.  [2]For example, initially I thought maybe this principle only applied\\nto Internet startups.  Obviously it worked for Google, but what\\nabout Microsoft?  Surely Microsoft isn't benevolent?  But when I\\nthink back to the beginning, they were.  Compared to IBM they were\\nlike Robin Hood.  When IBM introduced the PC, they thought they\\nwere going to make money selling hardware at high prices.  But by\\ngaining control of the PC standard, Microsoft opened up the market\\nto any manufacturer.  Hardware prices plummeted, and lots of people\\ngot to have computers who couldn't otherwise have afforded them.\\nIt's the sort of thing you'd expect Google to do.Microsoft isn't so benevolent now.  Now when one thinks of what\\nMicrosoft does to users, all the verbs that come to mind begin with\\nF.  [3] And yet it doesn't seem to pay.\\nTheir stock price has been flat for years.  Back when they were\\nRobin Hood, their stock price rose like Google's.  Could there be\\na connection?You can see how there would be.  When you're small, you can't bully\\ncustomers, so you have to charm them.  Whereas when you're big you\\ncan maltreat them at will, and you tend to, because it's easier\\nthan satisfying them.  You grow big by being nice, but you can stay\\nbig by being mean.You get away with it till the underlying conditions change, and\\nthen all your victims escape.  So \\\"Don't be evil\\\" may be the most\\nvaluable thing Paul Buchheit made for Google, because it may turn\\nout to be an elixir of corporate youth.  I'm sure they find it\\nconstraining, but think how valuable it will be if it saves them\\nfrom lapsing into the fatal laziness that afflicted Microsoft and\\nIBM.The curious thing is, this elixir is freely available to any other\\ncompany.  Anyone can adopt \\\"Don't be evil.\\\"  The catch is that\\npeople will hold you to it.  So I don't think you're going to see\\nrecord labels or tobacco companies using this discovery.MoraleThere's a lot of external evidence that benevolence works.  But how\\ndoes it work?  One advantage of investing in a large number of\\nstartups is that you get a lot of data about how they work.  From\\nwhat we've seen, being good seems to help startups in three ways:\\nit improves their morale, it makes other people want to help them,\\nand above all, it helps them be decisive.Morale is tremendously important to a startup—so important\\nthat morale alone is almost enough to determine success.  Startups\\nare often described as emotional roller-coasters. One minute you're\\ngoing to take over the world, and the next you're doomed.  The\\nproblem with feeling you're doomed is not just that it makes you\\nunhappy, but that it makes you stop working.  So the downhills\\nof the roller-coaster are more of a self fulfilling prophecy than\\nthe uphills.  If feeling you're going to succeed makes you work\\nharder, that probably improves your chances of succeeding, but if\\nfeeling you're going to fail makes you stop working, that practically\\nguarantees you'll fail.Here's where benevolence comes in.  If you feel you're really helping\\npeople, you'll keep working even when it seems like your startup\\nis doomed.  Most of us have some amount of natural benevolence.\\nThe mere fact that someone needs you makes you want to help them.\\nSo if you start the kind of startup where users come back each day,\\nyou've basically built yourself a giant tamagotchi.  You've made\\nsomething you need to take care of.Blogger is a famous example of a startup that went through really\\nlow lows and survived.  At one point they ran out of money and\\neveryone left. Evan Williams came in to work the next day, and there\\nwas no one but him.  What kept him going?  Partly that users needed\\nhim.  He was hosting thousands of people's blogs. He couldn't just\\nlet the site die.There are many advantages of launching quickly, but the most important\\nmay be that once you have users, the tamagotchi effect kicks in.\\nOnce you have users to take care of, you're forced to figure out\\nwhat will make them happy, and that's actually very valuable\\ninformation.The added confidence that comes from trying to help people can\\nalso help you with investors. One of the founders of \\nChatterous told \\nme recently that he and his cofounder had decided that this service\\nwas something the world needed, so they were going to keep working\\non it no matter what, even if they had to move back to Canada and live\\nin their parents' basements.Once they realized this, they stopped caring so much what investors thought\\nabout them.  They still met with them, but they weren't going to\\ndie if they didn't get their money.  And you know what?  The investors\\ngot a lot more interested.  They could sense that the Chatterouses\\nwere going to do this startup with or without them.If you're really committed and your startup is cheap to run, you\\nbecome very hard to kill.  And practically all startups, even the\\nmost successful, come close to death at some point.  So if doing\\ngood for people gives you a sense of mission that makes you harder\\nto kill, that alone more than compensates for whatever you lose by\\nnot choosing a more selfish project.HelpAnother advantage of being good is that it makes other people want\\nto help you.  This too seems to be an inborn trait in humans.One of the startups we've funded, Octopart, is currently locked in\\na classic battle of good versus evil.  They're a search site for\\nindustrial components.  A lot of people need to search for components,\\nand before Octopart there was no good way to do it.  That, it turned\\nout, was no coincidence.Octopart built the right way to search for components.  Users like\\nit and they've been growing rapidly.  And yet for most of Octopart's\\nlife, the biggest distributor, Digi-Key, has been trying to force\\nthem take their prices off the site.  Octopart is sending them\\ncustomers for free, and yet Digi-Key is trying to make that traffic\\nstop.  Why?  Because their current business model depends on\\novercharging people who have incomplete information about prices.\\nThey don't want search to work.The Octoparts are the nicest guys in the world.  They dropped out\\nof the PhD program in physics at Berkeley to do this.  They just\\nwanted to fix a problem they encountered in their research.  Imagine\\nhow much time you could save the world's engineers if they could\\ndo searches online.  So when I hear that a big, evil company is\\ntrying to stop them in order to keep search broken, it makes me\\nreally want to help them. It makes me spend more time on the Octoparts\\nthan I do with most of the other startups we've funded.  It just\\nmade me spend several minutes telling you how great they are.  Why?\\nBecause they're good guys and they're trying to help the world.If you're benevolent, people will rally around you: investors,\\ncustomers, other companies, and potential employees.  In the long\\nterm the most important may be the potential employees.  I think\\neveryone knows now that \\ngood hackers are much better than mediocre\\nones.  If you can attract the best hackers to work for you, as\\nGoogle has, you have a big advantage.  And the very best hackers\\ntend to be idealistic.  They're not desperate for a job.  They can\\nwork wherever they want.  So most want to work on things that will\\nmake the world better.CompassBut the most important advantage of being good is that it acts as\\na compass.  One of the hardest parts of doing a startup is that you\\nhave so many choices.  There are just two or three of you, and a\\nthousand things you could do. How do you decide?Here's the answer: Do whatever's best for your users.  You can hold\\nonto this like a rope in a hurricane, and it will save you if\\nanything can.  Follow it and it will take you through everything\\nyou need to do.It's even the answer to questions that seem unrelated, like how to\\nconvince investors to give you money.  If you're a good salesman,\\nyou could try to just talk them into it.  But the more reliable\\nroute is to convince them through your users: if you make something\\nusers love enough to tell their friends, you grow exponentially,\\nand that will convince any investor.Being good is a particularly useful strategy for making decisions\\nin complex situations because it's stateless.  It's like telling\\nthe truth.  The trouble with lying is that you have to remember\\neverything you've said in the past to make sure you don't contradict\\nyourself.  If you tell the truth you don't have to remember anything,\\nand that's a really useful property in domains where things happen\\nfast.For example, Y Combinator has now invested in 80 startups, 57 of\\nwhich are still alive.  (The rest have died or merged or been\\nacquired.)  When you're trying to advise 57 startups, it turns out\\nyou have to have a stateless algorithm.  You can't have ulterior\\nmotives when you have 57 things going on at once, because you can't\\nremember them.  So our rule is just to do whatever's best for the\\nfounders.  Not because we're particularly benevolent, but because\\nit's the only algorithm that works on that scale.When you write something telling people to be good, you seem to be\\nclaiming to be good yourself.  So I want to say explicitly that I\\nam not a particularly good person.  When I was a kid I was firmly\\nin the camp of bad.  The way adults used the word good, it seemed\\nto be synonymous with quiet, so I grew up very suspicious of it.You know how there are some people whose names come up in conversation\\nand everyone says \\\"He's such a great guy?\\\"  People never say\\nthat about me.  The best I get is \\\"he means well.\\\"  I am not claiming\\nto be good.  At best I speak good as a second language.So I'm not suggesting you be good in the usual sanctimonious way.\\nI'm suggesting it because it works.  It will work not just as a\\nstatement of \\\"values,\\\" but as a guide to strategy,\\nand even a design spec for software.  Don't just not be evil.  Be\\ngood.Notes[1] Fifty years ago\\nit would have seemed shocking for a public company not to pay\\ndividends.  Now many tech companies don't.  The markets seem to\\nhave figured out how to value potential dividends.  Maybe that isn't\\nthe last step in this evolution.  Maybe markets will eventually get\\ncomfortable with potential earnings. (VCs already are, and at least\\nsome of them consistently make money.)I realize this sounds like the stuff one used to hear about the\\n\\\"new economy\\\" during the Bubble.  Believe me, I was not drinking\\nthat kool-aid at the time.  But I'm convinced there were some \\ngood\\nideas buried in Bubble thinking.  For example, it's ok to focus on\\ngrowth instead of profits—but only if the growth is genuine.\\nYou can't be buying users; that's a pyramid scheme.   But a company\\nwith rapid, genuine growth is valuable, and eventually markets learn\\nhow to value valuable things.[2] The idea of starting\\na company with benevolent aims is currently undervalued, because\\nthe kind of people who currently make that their explicit goal don't\\nusually do a very good job.It's one of the standard career paths of trustafarians to start\\nsome vaguely benevolent business.  The problem with most of them\\nis that they either have a bogus political agenda or are feebly\\nexecuted.  The trustafarians' ancestors didn't get rich by preserving\\ntheir traditional culture; maybe people in Bolivia don't want to\\neither.  And starting an organic farm, though it's at least\\nstraightforwardly benevolent, doesn't help people on the scale that\\nGoogle does.Most explicitly benevolent projects don't hold themselves sufficiently\\naccountable.  They act as if having good intentions were enough to\\nguarantee good effects.[3] Users dislike their\\nnew operating system so much that they're starting petitions to\\nsave the old one.  And the old one was nothing special.  The hackers\\nwithin Microsoft must know in their hearts that if the company\\nreally cared about users they'd just advise them to switch to OSX.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit, Jessica Livingston,\\nand Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.\\n\\nHow not to die\\n\\nAugust 2007\\n\\n(This is a talk I gave at the last Y Combinator dinner of the summer. Usually we don't have a speaker at the last dinner; it's more of a party. But it seemed worth spoiling the atmosphere if I could save some of the startups from preventable deaths. So at the last minute I cooked up this rather grim talk. I didn't mean this as an essay; I wrote it down because I only had two hours before dinner and think fastest while writing.)\\n\\nA couple days ago I told a reporter that we expected about a third of the companies we funded to succeed. Actually I was being conservative. I'm hoping it might be as much as a half. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could achieve a 50% success rate?\\n\\nAnother way of saying that is that half of you are going to die. Phrased that way, it doesn't sound good at all. In fact, it's kind of weird when you think about it, because our definition of success is that the founders get rich. If half the startups we fund succeed, then half of you are going to get rich and the other half are going to get nothing.\\n\\nIf you can just avoid dying, you get rich. That sounds like a joke, but it's actually a pretty good description of what happens in a typical startup. It certainly describes what happened in Viaweb. We avoided dying till we got rich.\\n\\nIt was really close, too. When we were visiting Yahoo to talk about being acquired, we had to interrupt everything and borrow one of their conference rooms to talk down an investor who was about to back out of a new funding round we needed to stay alive. So even in the middle of getting rich we were fighting off the grim reaper.\\n\\nYou may have heard that quote about luck consisting of opportunity meeting preparation. You've now done the preparation. The work you've done so far has, in effect, put you in a position to get lucky: you can now get rich by not letting your company die. That's more than most people have. So let's talk about how not to die.\\n\\nWe've done this five times now, and we've seen a bunch of startups die. About 10 of them so far. We don't know exactly what happens when they die, because they generally don't die loudly and heroically. Mostly they crawl off somewhere and die.\\n\\nFor us the main indication of impending doom is when we don't hear from you. When we haven't heard from, or about, a startup for a couple months, that's a bad sign. If we send them an email asking what's up, and they don't reply, that's a really bad sign. So far that is a 100% accurate predictor of death.\\n\\nWhereas if a startup regularly does new deals and releases and either sends us mail or shows up at YC events, they're probably going to live.\\n\\nI realize this will sound naive, but maybe the linkage works in both directions. Maybe if you can arrange that we keep hearing from you, you won't die.\\n\\nThat may not be so naive as it sounds. You've probably noticed that having dinners every Tuesday with us and the other founders causes you to get more done than you would otherwise, because every dinner is a mini Demo Day. Every dinner is a kind of a deadline. So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you'll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven't done anything new since the last time we talked.\\n\\nIf this works, it would be an amazing hack. It would be pretty cool if merely by staying in regular contact with us you could get rich. It sounds crazy, but there's a good chance that would work.\\n\\nA variant is to stay in touch with other YC-funded startups. There is now a whole neighborhood of them in San Francisco. If you move there, the peer pressure that made you work harder all summer will continue to operate.\\n\\nWhen startups die, the official cause of death is always either running out of money or a critical founder bailing. Often the two occur simultaneously. But I think the underlying cause is usually that they've become demoralized. You rarely hear of a startup that's working around the clock doing deals and pumping out new features, and dies because they can't pay their bills and their ISP unplugs their server.\\n\\nStartups rarely die in mid keystroke. So keep typing!\\n\\nIf so many startups get demoralized and fail when merely by hanging on they could get rich, you have to assume that running a startup can be demoralizing. That is certainly true. I've been there, and that's why I've never done another startup. The low points in a startup are just unbelievably low. I bet even Google had moments where things seemed hopeless.\\n\\nKnowing that should help. If you know it's going to feel terrible sometimes, then when it feels terrible you won't think \\\"ouch, this feels terrible, I give up.\\\" It feels that way for everyone. And if you just hang on, things will probably get better. The metaphor people use to describe the way a startup feels is at least a roller coaster and not drowning. You don't just sink and sink; there are ups after the downs.\\n\\nAnother feeling that seems alarming but is in fact normal in a startup is the feeling that what you're doing isn't working. The reason you can expect to feel this is that what you do probably won't work. Startups almost never get it right the first time. Much more commonly you launch something, and no one cares. Don't assume when this happens that you've failed. That's normal for startups. But don't sit around doing nothing. Iterate.\\n\\nI like Paul Buchheit's suggestion of trying to make something that at least someone really loves. As long as you've made something that a few users are ecstatic about, you're on the right track. It will be good for your morale to have even a handful of users who really love you, and startups run on morale. But also it will tell you what to focus on. What is it about you that they love? Can you do more of that? Where can you find more people who love that sort of thing? As long as you have some core of users who love you, all you have to do is expand it. It may take a while, but as long as you keep plugging away, you'll win in the end. Both Blogger and Delicious did that. Both took years to succeed. But both began with a core of fanatically devoted users, and all Evan and Joshua had to do was grow that core incrementally. Wufoo is on the same trajectory now.\\n\\nSo when you release something and it seems like no one cares, look more closely. Are there zero users who really love you, or is there at least some little group that does? It's quite possible there will be zero. In that case, tweak your product and try again. Every one of you is working on a space that contains at least one winning permutation somewhere in it. If you just keep trying, you'll find it.\\n\\nLet me mention some things not to do. The number one thing not to do is other things. If you find yourself saying a sentence that ends with \\\"but we're going to keep working on the startup,\\\" you are in big trouble. Bob's going to grad school, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're moving back to Minnesota, but we're going to keep working on the startup. We're taking on some consulting projects, but we're going to keep working on the startup. You may as well just translate these to \\\"we're giving up on the startup, but we're not willing to admit that to ourselves,\\\" because that's what it means most of the time. A startup is so hard that working on it can't be preceded by \\\"but.\\\"\\n\\nIn particular, don't go to graduate school, and don't start other projects. Distraction is fatal to startups. Going to (or back to) school is a huge predictor of death because in addition to the distraction it gives you something to say you're doing. If you're only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail. If you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later \\\"Oh yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school, but it didn't go anywhere.\\\"\\n\\nYou can't use euphemisms like \\\"didn't go anywhere\\\" for something that's your only occupation. People won't let you.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting things we've discovered from working on Y Combinator is that founders are more motivated by the fear of looking bad than by the hope of getting millions of dollars. So if you want to get millions of dollars, put yourself in a position where failure will be public and humiliating.\\n\\nWhen we first met the founders of Octopart, they seemed very smart, but not a great bet to succeed, because they didn't seem especially committed. One of the two founders was still in grad school. It was the usual story: he'd drop out if it looked like the startup was taking off. Since then he has not only dropped out of grad school, but appeared full length in Newsweek with the word \\\"Billionaire\\\" printed across his chest. He just cannot fail now. Everyone he knows has seen that picture. Girls who dissed him in high school have seen it. His mom probably has it on the fridge. It would be unthinkably humiliating to fail now. At this point he is committed to fight to the death.\\n\\nI wish every startup we funded could appear in a Newsweek article describing them as the next generation of billionaires, because then none of them would be able to give up. The success rate would be 90%. I'm not kidding.\\n\\nWhen we first knew the Octoparts they were lighthearted, cheery guys. Now when we talk to them they seem grimly determined. The electronic parts distributors are trying to squash them to keep their monopoly pricing. (If it strikes you as odd that people still order electronic parts out of thick paper catalogs in 2007, there's a reason for that. The distributors want to prevent the transparency that comes from having prices online.) I feel kind of bad that we've transformed these guys from lighthearted to grimly determined. But that comes with the territory. If a startup succeeds, you get millions of dollars, and you don't get that kind of money just by asking for it. You have to assume it takes some amount of pain.\\n\\nAnd however tough things get for the Octoparts, I predict they'll succeed. They may have to morph themselves into something totally different, but they won't just crawl off and die. They're smart; they're working in a promising field; and they just cannot give up.\\n\\nAll of you guys already have the first two. You're all smart and working on promising ideas. Whether you end up among the living or the dead comes down to the third ingredient, not giving up.\\n\\nSo I'll tell you now: bad shit is coming. It always is in a startup. The odds of getting from launch to liquidity without some kind of disaster happening are one in a thousand. So don't get demoralized. When the disaster strikes, just say to yourself, ok, this was what Paul was talking about. What did he say to do? Oh, yeah. Don't give up.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"LsA+kzAzClRMtCpyK8uZ7r7A6BQ3oXwG/n3t5TrZz00=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/constitution.pdf_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/constitution.pdf_1\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":1,\"total_pages\":15,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/constitution.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"constitution.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"Page I\\n1 This text of the Constitution follows the engrossed copy\\nsigned by Gen.

better\\nalign fields/buttons/boxes and improve consistency among the sub-forms. Some button actions now display\\nmore explanatory text. A few of the changes are given below as an example:\\n1. The “Select New Vehicle” button was reduced in size and re-labelled “Change Vehicle”.\\n2. A new “status update” field is displayed which shows the most recent status change. The status is linked\\ndirectly to the entries in the Notes tab on the right side of the form. A small number of common status\\nupdates is automatic, such as when the “Book It” button is pressed.\\n3. The time, as well as the date, is displayed in this area.\\n4. The dollar values are all right-aligned, making it easier to account for each amount. Also, the ‘Estimate\\nDetails” and “Final Details” panels are more in-sync with their values throughout the rental process.\\n5. Fields which are editable are more consistently displayed with a white background, while read-only fields\\nare in light gray and are not clickable.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"OXAvjs+AOvXwTmChxpbFJzU+38dbE7fIEQA4jNbS828=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_5\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":5,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes 4\\nCHECK AVAILABILITY FORM IMPROVEMENTS\\nHome -> Check Availability\\nOnce dates are selected the Check Availability form now automatically updates the search results as you select\\nvehicle classes, select locations, change dates, etc.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"7QxXRY2YcKnqUI5Ydwyd9Dv6Dyxlh6alw82VGjSMLSs=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_6\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":6,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes 5\\nLOCATION CALENDAR IMPROVEMENTS\\nAdmin -> Locations/Contracts -> Find Location -> Calendar\\nThe Calendar tab, formerly only for Booking Portal users, is now available on the Location panel.

The intent is to help you determine\\nif there are any common configuration issues, missing information, etc. You can manually run the validation\\nsuite whenever you like. It is especially helpful as you’re initially configuring the Portal.\\nIn addition, the suite is run in the background every ~60 days, and will display a message if any issues are\\nfound. For example, one of the most common issues is that Rental Rates for a Class are not configured for up\\nto a year out. One of the validation methods will issue a warning if Rental Rates are not configured for at least\\n14 months ahead of time, giving you ample time to address the issue.\\nAbove is an example of the message that appears when the validation is run manually. In this case, the “Future\\nRental Rates” validation found an issue. Only a summary of issues is displayed here. A detailed report is saved\\nin your Documents folder, in a file named “BookingPortalValidtion.txt”, which you can access as per the above\\nmessage. The document is replaced every time validation is run.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Y4ZfbpUdwG3B1aepYhTBBsMYA2nxSa0MCy91EI3dWnA=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_9":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_9\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":9,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes 8\\nIn the above example of the detailed text document, a number of validations were performed to cover the\\nmost frequent/serious issues.

This is especially useful if you are doing\\ninitial setup, some maintenance, or have multiple locations, but only rent online at a subset of them.\\n- Enabled: The Booking Portal for the location is visible to online customers\\n- Under Construction: The Booking Portal for the location displays an “Under Construction” banner\\n- Disabled: The Booking Portal for the location is not visible\\nNote: Available by TBD\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"2AxjOxAdk6PS4G+98xqaY3CYO3q9pvz+lphITEOfAZU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_10":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_10\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":10,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes 9\\nGeneral Improvements/Fixes\\nRENTAL CONTRACT VEHICLE CATEGORIES\\nAdmin -> Look-Ups -> Rental Contract Vehicle Categories\\nNote: Formerly “Rental Categories”\\nTypically, a group of vehicle classes can all be covered under a single rental contract. Depending on your\\nbusiness style, you can make a general rental contract to cover many vehicle classes, or separate, more\\ndetailed contracts specific to individual vehicle classes. In either case, a Rental Contract Vehicle Category is\\nwhat links a vehicle class to a specific rental contract at a location.\\nThe Vehicle Categories for Rental Contracts form outlines the steps you would typically take to associate a\\nvehicle and it’s class with a location and rental contract, by first creating a suitable category with your choice\\nof name and description, such as “ATV” for a rental contract that covers all vehicles in the ATV class. Then\\nfollow Steps 1 – 3 to complete the process.\\nNote: A given Location can have only one Rental Contract for a given Vehicle Category. E.g., if you had two\\ndissimilar ATV Classes at a location requiring different contracts, you would create two different Vehicle\\nCategories, one for each ATV class.\\nNote: A given Vehicle Category can be used at multiple locations; at each location you should create a rental\\ncontract for that vehicle category, assuming there are appropriate vehicles at the location.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"MPAH6q8hoFzFh2Bj9o9Qyxm+LETVsxbPU9xWByBjgDw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_11":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_11\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":11,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes 10\\nADVERTISING SOURCE ARCHIVING\\nAdmin -> Look-Ups -> Advertising Source\\nYou can now “archive” an advertising source (rather than deleting it) – it is saved for historical purposes and\\npotential analysis.

Dealership Software will be\\ndeprecating the functionality of sending/receiving email directly from Dealership Software email servers. This\\nmeans that each company will need to configure eWebRenter to use an email server of their choice, as well as\\ndesignating a “reply-to” address. This configuration is done for each location, on the Location Information\\nform under the Email Settings tab. You can use the same or different information for each location.\\nYou can continue (and it is recommended) to send email to customers via eWebRenter; sent emails will be\\nlogged so you may review them at any time. You may also include multiple attachments in the email.\\nHowever, when a customer replies to an email, the reply will now be sent to the email address you designate\\nin the “Default Reply-To Address” field, for example “rental-agent@your_company.com”. You may want to\\nensure that email sent to this default email address accessible to all agents so that they have access to all\\nresponses.\\nNote: The Port is required and must use SSL/TLS (typically 465 or 587).\\nNote: The Outgoing SMTP server usually begins with “smtp.”, e.g. smtp.my_email_server.com\\nIf you are not sure which email settings to use, contact your IT department or ISP.\\nOnce you have entered your settings, click “Test Settings”. If the settings are correct, you will receive an email\\nat the “Default Reply-To address; otherwise an error will be displayed along with some level of hopefully\\nhelpful information.\\nBy default, when you initially update to eWebRenter v10.49, and while you transition to your new email\\nserver, the “Temporarily use legacy email server” checkbox is ticked, which will cause email to be sent via\\nDealership Software’s email server. However, you will be prompted to configure your own email server every\\ntime an email is sent.

pixel-pushing changes to better\\nalign fields/buttons/boxes and improve consistency among the sub-forms. Some button actions now display\\nmore explanatory text. A few of the changes are given below as an example:\\n1. The “Select New Vehicle” button was reduced in size and re-labelled “Change Vehicle”.\\n2. A new “status update” field is displayed which shows the most recent status change. The status is linked\\ndirectly to the entries in the Notes tab on the right side of the form. A small number of common status\\nupdates is automatic, such as when the “Book It” button is pressed.\\n3. The time, as well as the date, is displayed in this area.\\n4.

The intent is to help you determine\\nif there are any common configuration issues, missing information, etc. You can manually run the validation\\nsuite whenever you like. It is especially helpful as you’re initially configuring the Portal.\\nIn addition, the suite is run in the background every ~60 days, and will display a message if any issues are\\nfound. For example, one of the most common issues is that Rental Rates for a Class are not configured for up\\nto a year out. One of the validation methods will issue a warning if Rental Rates are not configured for at least\\n14 months ahead of time, giving you ample time to address the issue.\\nAbove is an example of the message that appears when the validation is run manually. In this case, the “Future\\nRental Rates” validation found an issue. Only a summary of issues is displayed here. A detailed report is saved\\nin your Documents folder, in a file named “BookingPortalValidtion.txt”, which you can access as per the above\\nmessage.

In either case, a Rental Contract Vehicle Category is\\nwhat links a vehicle class to a specific rental contract at a location.\\nThe Vehicle Categories for Rental Contracts form outlines the steps you would typically take to associate a\\nvehicle and it’s class with a location and rental contract, by first creating a suitable category with your choice\\nof name and description, such as “ATV” for a rental contract that covers all vehicles in the ATV class. Then\\nfollow Steps 1 – 3 to complete the process.\\nNote: A given Location can have only one Rental Contract for a given Vehicle Category. E.g., if you had two\\ndissimilar ATV Classes at a location requiring different contracts, you would create two different Vehicle\\nCategories, one for each ATV class.\\nNote: A given Vehicle Category can be used at multiple locations; at each location you should create a rental\\ncontract for that vehicle category, assuming there are appropriate vehicles at the location.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"BVp438khofkmMn9XeJAO4rWl8Ph9b2G2nqeSUc+s17I=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"eb1882df-b350-4d3b-9efe-01b62d134f69":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"eb1882df-b350-4d3b-9efe-01b62d134f69\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":11,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_11\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":11,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"4VaD/Ix4DraUf6hQYqBjXxduImOlmy5FKGfalK6l4cY=\"}},\"text\":\"file_name: eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\\nfile_path: /Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\\npage_number: 11\\nprivate: false\\ntotal_pages: 38\\n\\neWebRenter Release Notes 10\\nADVERTISING SOURCE ARCHIVING\\nAdmin -> Look-Ups -> Advertising Source\\nYou can now “archive” an advertising source (rather than deleting it) – it is saved for historical purposes and\\npotential analysis.

This value is included in the availability calculation.\\n- A fourth “reservation mode” which allows a customer to request a booking, including prices and\\navailability, while creating a reservation in EWebRenter, but NOT booking the reservation.\\n- A customer can now filter on Awning, Towing, Pets, and Smoking.

Dealership Software will be\\ndeprecating the functionality of sending/receiving email directly from Dealership Software email servers. This\\nmeans that each company will need to configure eWebRenter to use an email server of their choice, as well as\\ndesignating a “reply-to” address. This configuration is done for each location, on the Location Information\\nform under the Email Settings tab. You can use the same or different information for each location.\\nYou can continue (and it is recommended) to send email to customers via eWebRenter; sent emails will be\\nlogged so you may review them at any time. You may also include multiple attachments in the email.\\nHowever, when a customer replies to an email, the reply will now be sent to the email address you designate\\nin the “Default Reply-To Address” field, for example “rental-agent@your_company.com”. You may want to\\nensure that email sent to this default email address accessible to all agents so that they have access to all\\nresponses.\\nNote: The Port is required and must use SSL/TLS (typically 465 or 587).\\nNote: The Outgoing SMTP server usually begins with “smtp.”, e.g. smtp.my_email_server.com\\nIf you are not sure which email settings to use, contact your IT department or ISP.\\nOnce you have entered your settings, click “Test Settings”.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\",\"hash\":\"RSv3fx+5Z24S/yBsViKx4ciubDfkGbP7ELhegx8Xc14=\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"acf66d18-f78a-4235-84bf-c3f6c59fc995":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"acf66d18-f78a-4235-84bf-c3f6c59fc995\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"./data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf_24\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"sV5fnj740na3me+ToWIquPmwf6p/w0Sn+YS0X0DNrFI=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"766b1146-c8eb-47a8-a8dd-185bb97c5062\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":24,\"total_pages\":38,\"file_path\":\"/Users/imobyl/Syn-Dev/sites/DoNotBackup/Udemy-AI-FromZeroToMastery/Level 3/Section 36/FE/data/eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"eWebRenter Release Notes.pdf\",\"private\":\"false\"},\"hash\":\"RSv3fx+5Z24S/yBsViKx4ciubDfkGbP7ELhegx8Xc14=\"}},\"text\":\"contact your IT department or ISP.\\nOnce you have entered your settings, click “Test Settings”.

(When creating an email template, you may choose to add this link by default, though you\\nmay also over-ride the default option when generating the email.) When the customer clicks on the link in the\\nemail they receive, they will be taken to an online form where they have an option to review, add or edit\\ninformation about themselves, such as their current address, Social Security Number, etc..
